# IMDb Web Scraping Project

This project delves into the extraction of data from multiple web pages, with a primary focus on IMDb's Top 1,000 movies spread across 20 pages. This achievement is facilitated through the implementation of a robust Python-based web scraper.

## Overview



 **Import Libraries:** Import the necessary libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, and more.

**Set Headers:** Set headers to specify our preferred language when making requests.

**Initialize Empty Lists:** Create empty lists to store movie data.

**Create a Range of Page Numbers:** We'll use a loop to iterate through pages. This range will be used to generate the page numbers.

**Loop Through Pages:**
   Make a request to IMDb's URL for each page.
   Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
   Find movie containers on the page.
   Introduce sleep periods to control the crawl rate.

**Extract and Append Data:**
   
  - Movie Name
  - Year
  - RunTime
  - Rating
  - Metascore
  - Votes
  - Gross
  - Genre
  - Certificate
  - Star
  - Description
   
   Append extracted data to respective lists.

 **Create a DataFrame:**
   Create a DataFrame to store the scraped data.
   Include columns for movie title, year, IMDb rating, metascore, votes, gross earnings, and runtime.

 **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
   Convert data to appropriate data types.
   Handle missing data using default values or dropping rows/columns.

 **Save DataFrame to CSV:** Save the cleaned data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Basic Data-Quality Best Practices (Optional)

 **Handling Missing Data:**
   Check for missing data using the `.isnull().sum()` method.
   Consider filling missing values with default values or deleting rows/columns with significant missing data.

 **Data Type Consistency:**
   Ensure data types are consistent and appropriate for each column.

By following these steps and best practices, you'll create a robust web scraping script that extracts valuable data from multiple pages on IMDb and ensures data quality for analysis.
